## Description

Making plans or deciding on where to meet with friends can be a tough decision to make. Some plans never make it past this stage of uncertainty. At times, it is never certain where a good midpoint is between you and your friends. “HalfWay” is a web application that can solve this issue of indecision and ambiguity. 

The purpose of this application will be to provide a convenient midpoint for meetups by designating friends an approximately equal distance to travel. It will assist users to plan meetups more efficiently, suggest points of interest near the calculated midpoint, and allow users to save their trips for future reference. Users will be able to reflect upon their past trips with friends, view trip details, and add other users as friends and plan trips with friends of their choice.

The development of this application would improve quality of life for users and foster stronger connections between friends from different distances. Use of this application would also eliminate the time-consuming process of manually calculating and comparing distances between locations by providing a seamless and efficient solution for finding midpoints between users.
